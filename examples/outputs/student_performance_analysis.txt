### **Section 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Deep Dive** ðŸ“ŠðŸ”¬

This section provides a comprehensive statistical exploration of the dataset. The goal is to understand the data's underlying structure, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and extract key insights. Unless specified, all analyses are performed on the full dataset. Over 60 statistical tests and checks are considered in this module.

**3.1. EDA Methodology Overview:**
* **Approach:** Systematic univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis using streaming algorithms.
* **Column Type Classification:** Each column is analysed based on its inferred data type (Numerical, Categorical, Date/Time, Boolean, Text).
* **Statistical Significance:** Standard p-value thresholds (e.g., 0.05) are used where applicable, but effect sizes and practical significance are also considered.
* **Memory-Efficient Processing:** Streaming with online algorithms ensures scalability to large datasets.
* **Sampling Strategy:** Analysis performed on the complete dataset.

**3.2. Univariate Analysis (Per-Column In-Depth Profile):**

*This sub-section provides detailed statistical profiles for each column in the dataset, adapted based on detected data type.*
