## 6.4 CART (Decision Tree) Methodology Deep Dive

### 6.4.1 CART Methodology Overview

CART (Classification and Regression Trees) methodology for classification:

**Core Algorithm:**
1. **Recursive Binary Partitioning:** The algorithm recursively splits the dataset into two subsets based on feature values that optimize the splitting criterion.

2. **Splitting Criterion:** Uses Gini impurity or information gain to evaluate potential splits. For each possible split on each feature, the algorithm calculates the improvement in the criterion and selects the best split.

3. **Greedy Approach:** At each node, CART makes the locally optimal choice without considering future splits, which makes it computationally efficient but potentially suboptimal globally.

4. **Binary Splits Only:** Unlike other decision tree algorithms, CART produces only binary splits, which simplifies the tree structure and interpretation.

**Mathematical Foundation:**
For classification trees, common splitting criteria include:

**Gini Impurity:** Gini(S) = 1 - Œ£(pi)¬≤
where pi is the proportion of samples belonging to class i

**Information Gain (Entropy):** 
- Entropy(S) = -Œ£(pi * log2(pi))
- Information Gain = Entropy(parent) - weighted_avg(Entropy(children))

**Prediction:** For a leaf node, prediction = majority class in that leaf
**Probability Estimation:** P(class i) = proportion of class i samples in leaf

**Key Advantages:**
- Non-parametric: No assumptions about data distribution
- Handles mixed data types naturally (numerical and categorical)
- Automatic feature selection through recursive splitting
- Robust to outliers (splits based on order, not exact values)
- Highly interpretable through visual tree structure
- Can capture non-linear relationships and feature interactions

**Limitations to Consider:**
- High variance: Small changes in data can lead to very different trees
- Bias toward features with many possible splits
- Can easily overfit without proper pruning
- Instability: Sensitive to data perturbations

### 6.4.2 Splitting Criterion

**Selected Criterion:** Gini

### 6.4.3 Stopping Criteria Recommendations

**max_depth**
- **Recommended Value:** 9
- **Reasoning:** Limits tree complexity to prevent overfitting. Deeper trees capture more complexity but risk overfitting.

**min_samples_split**
- **Recommended Value:** 10
- **Reasoning:** Ensures each internal node has sufficient samples for reliable splits. Higher values prevent overfitting to noise.

**min_samples_leaf**
- **Recommended Value:** 5
- **Reasoning:** Guarantees each leaf has minimum samples for stable predictions. Prevents creation of leaves with very few samples.

**min_impurity_decrease**
- **Recommended Value:** 0
- **Reasoning:** Can be used to require minimum improvement for splits. Set to 0.01-0.05 if overfitting is observed.

**max_leaf_nodes**
- **Recommended Value:** null
- **Reasoning:** Alternative to max_depth for controlling tree size. Consider using for very unbalanced trees.

### 6.4.4 Pruning Strategy

**Method:** Cost complexity
**Cross-Validation Folds:** 5
**Complexity Parameter:** 0.01

**Reasoning:**
Cost-complexity pruning (also known as minimal cost-complexity pruning) is the standard CART pruning method:

**Algorithm:**
1. Grow a large tree using stopping criteria
2. For each subtree T, calculate cost-complexity measure: R_Œ±(T) = R(T) + Œ±|T|
   - R(T) = misclassification rate
   - |T| = number of leaf nodes
   - Œ± = complexity parameter (cost per leaf)

3. Find sequence of nested subtrees by increasing Œ±
4. Use cross-validation to select optimal Œ± that minimizes misclassification rate

**Benefits:**
- Theoretically grounded approach
- Automatically determines optimal tree size
- Balances model complexity with predictive accuracy
- Reduces overfitting while maintaining interpretability

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use 5-fold cross-validation to estimate generalization error
- Select Œ± within one standard error of minimum (1-SE rule)
- Monitor both training and validation performance during pruning

### 6.4.5 Tree Interpretation Guidance

**Expected Tree Characteristics:**
- **Estimated Depth:** 6 levels
- **Estimated Leaves:** 32 terminal nodes

**Example Decision Paths:**

1. **Path to high-value prediction**
   - **Conditions:** student_id > threshold_1 AND gender <= threshold_2 AND study_hours_per_day in [category_A, category_B]
   - **Prediction:** Positive class
   - **Business Meaning:** When student_id is high and gender is moderate, the model predicts positive outcomes

2. **Path to low-value prediction**
   - **Conditions:** student_id <= threshold_1
   - **Prediction:** Negative class
   - **Business Meaning:** When student_id is low, the model typically predicts negative outcomes regardless of other features

**Business Rule Translation:**
- IF-THEN Rule Translation: Decision trees naturally translate to business rules
- Each path from root to leaf represents a complete business rule
- Rules are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive
- Example structure: IF (condition1 AND condition2) THEN predict age = value
- For classification: Each leaf provides class prediction and probability estimates
- Rules can include confidence levels based on class purity in leaves
- Probability estimates help with decision thresholds and uncertainty quantification

### 6.4.6 Visualization Recommendations

1. Create tree structure diagram with node labels showing split conditions
2. Generate feature importance bar chart ranked by Gini importance
3. Produce scatter plot of actual vs predicted values with leaf node coloring
4. Create decision path examples showing top 5 most common prediction paths
5. Create confusion matrix with breakdown by major decision paths
6. Generate ROC curves for each major leaf node (treat as separate classifiers)
7. Plot class probability distributions for each leaf node
8. Create decision boundary visualization for top 2 features (if applicable)
