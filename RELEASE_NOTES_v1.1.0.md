- **Cross-Analysis Insights**: Connects patterns across data quality, statistics, and visualization needs
- **Business Impact Scoring**: Prioritizes findings by revenue, customer, and efficiency implications  
- **Concise Output**: 2-3 pages of actionable insights vs 100+ pages from 'all' command
- **Intelligent Caching**: 5-minute cache for instant re-runs
- **Actionable Focus**: Every insight includes what to do about it

### 📊 Comprehensive EDA Expansion
The `eda` command now includes:
- Advanced statistical insights with business context
