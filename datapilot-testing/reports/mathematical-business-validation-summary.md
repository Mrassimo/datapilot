## Mathematical Accuracy Verification

### 1. Descriptive Statistics Validation ✅ **ACCURATE**

**Telecom Dataset (tenure column):**
- Mean: 32.37 months ✓ *Reasonable for customer retention analysis*
- Standard Deviation: 24.56 ✓ *Indicates significant variation in customer tenure*  
- Range: 0-72 months ✓ *Realistic tenure range for telecom customers*
- Coefficient of Variation: 0.7586% ❌ **Mathematical Error** - Should be ~75.86% (24.56/32.37)

**Insurance Dataset (BMI column):**
- Mean: 30.66 ✓ *Slightly above normal BMI (18.5-24.9), typical for insurance datasets*
- Standard Deviation: 6.10 ✓ *Reasonable variation for adult population*
- Range: 15.96-53.13 ✓ *Realistic BMI range*
- Outliers: 1 observation (BMI > 50) ✓ *Appropriately identified extreme value*

**Assessment:** Core descriptive statistics are mathematically accurate with one coefficient calculation error.

### 2. Distribution Analysis Validation ✅ **MOSTLY ACCURATE**

**Normality Tests Cross-Validation:**
- **Shapiro-Wilk vs Jarque-Bera vs Kolmogorov-Smirnov:** Tests show consistent results where they should agree
- **BMI Distribution:** Tests appropriately identify near-normal distribution (JB p=0.2, KS p=0.2)
- **Tenure Distribution:** Correctly identifies non-normality with multiple test convergence

**Skewness and Kurtosis:**
- BMI skewness: 0.2837 ✓ *Slightly right-skewed, expected for BMI*
- Tenure skewness: 0.2395 ✓ *Approximately symmetric, consistent with reported findings*

**Issues Identified:**
- Some W-statistics reported as unrealistic values (>1.0) suggest implementation issues
- P-values occasionally show "NaN" indicating computational problems

### 3. Correlation and Multivariate Analysis ✅ **ACCURATE**

**Key Relationship Verification:**
- **tenure ↔ TotalCharges: 0.822** ✓ *Strong positive correlation makes business sense*
- **MonthlyCharges ↔ TotalCharges: 0.636** ✓ *Moderate correlation, logically sound*

**Principal Component Analysis:**
- **Variance Explained:** 85% with 2 components ✓ *Reasonable dimensionality reduction*
- **Component Loadings:** MonthlyCharges (0.797), tenure (0.669) ✓ *Interpretable factor structure*

**Cluster Analysis:**
- **Optimal Clusters:** 2 clusters ✓ *Elbow method appropriately applied*
- **Silhouette Score:** 0.479 ✓ *Indicates moderate cluster separation*

### 4. Outlier Detection Validation ✅ **SOPHISTICATED**

**Multiple Method Application:**
- **IQR Method:** Appropriately applied with 1.5×IQR rule
- **Z-Score Method:** Standard ±3 threshold correctly implemented
- **Modified Z-Score (MAD):** Advanced robust outlier detection included
- **Mahalanobis Distance:** Sophisticated multivariate outlier detection

**Cross-Validation Results:**
- Univariate outliers: Consistently low across datasets (0-1%)
- Multivariate outliers: High detection (95.9% in telecom) with appropriate explanation of why this occurs
