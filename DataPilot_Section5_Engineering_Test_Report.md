## Detailed Test Results

### 1. Schema Analysis & Optimization

**Performance**: ✅ **EXCELLENT**

The schema analysis component consistently delivered intelligent DDL generation and type optimisation:

#### Key Capabilities Validated:
- **Type Inference**: Successfully detected appropriate PostgreSQL data types (VARCHAR, INTEGER, NUMERIC, DATE, BIGINT)
- **Constraint Recommendations**: Generated primary key constraints for unique identifier columns
- **Column Optimization**: Intelligent VARCHAR sizing (e.g., `VARCHAR(100)` for names, `VARCHAR(50)` for status fields)
- **SQL DDL Generation**: Clean, production-ready CREATE TABLE statements

#### Business Value:
- **High**: Saves 4-8 hours of manual schema design per dataset
- Provides immediate SQL-ready schema for database deployment
- Consistent naming conventions (snake_case) across all recommendations

### 2. Feature Engineering for ML

**Performance**: ✅ **EXCELLENT**

The ML readiness assessment provides actionable feature engineering recommendations:

#### Validated Features:
- **Feature Naming**: Consistent `ml_` prefix for engineered features
- **Type Conversion**: Intelligent categorical vs numerical feature classification
- **Encoding Strategies**: Appropriate recommendations for categorical variables
- **ML Readiness Scores**: Consistent 85-89% scores with detailed improvement paths

#### Business Impact:
- **High**: Provides clear ML feature preparation roadmap
- Identifies specific encoding requirements (one-hot, label encoding)
- Estimates technical debt hours (6-8 hours typical)

### 3. Data Quality Integration

**Performance**: ✅ **GOOD**

Strong integration with Section 2 quality results:

#### Quality-Driven Recommendations:
- **Missing Value Strategies**: Median imputation for numerical, mode for categorical
- **Outlier Treatment**: Flagging columns for engineered features
- **Data Integrity Scores**: 95-97% for clean datasets, appropriately lower for problematic data

### 4. Scalability Assessment

**Performance**: ✅ **VERY GOOD**

Sophisticated analysis of dataset growth and technology recommendations:

#### Validated Capabilities:
- **Growth Projections**: 1-year capacity planning with complexity assessment
- **Technology Recommendations**: PostgreSQL for structured data with clear benefits/considerations
- **Performance Bottleneck Analysis**: Identifies potential scaling issues early

#### Scale Testing Results:
- **Small datasets** (≤1000 rows): Complete analysis in <10ms
- **Medium datasets** (7K rows): Analysis in ~2ms with full feature set
- **Large datasets** (540K+ rows): Successfully processed with memory optimisation warnings

### 5. Foreign Key Detection & Relationships

**Performance**: ⚠️ **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT**

Multi-file analysis shows promising framework but limited real-world accuracy:

#### Issues Identified:
- Join analysis appears to use synthetic/mock data rather than actual file content
- Relationships detected are based on schema patterns, not actual data validation
- Column matching relies heavily on naming conventions rather than data distribution analysis

#### Recommendations:
- Implement actual data sampling for relationship validation
- Add cardinality analysis based on real data distributions
- Enhance foreign key confidence scoring with actual overlap analysis

### 6. Performance Characteristics

#### Memory Management:
- **Small Files** (<1MB): Excellent performance, minimal memory usage
- **Large Files** (>40MB): Appropriate warnings at 620MB+ usage, graceful degradation
- **Memory Optimization**: Adaptive chunk sizing and streaming processing worked effectively

#### Processing Speed:
- **Schema Analysis**: Consistently fast (1-7ms)
- **Feature Engineering**: Rapid analysis across all dataset sizes
- **Quality Integration**: Acceptable performance (9-280ms depending on dataset size)
