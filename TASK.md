# DataPilot Task Tracker

## Completed Tasks

### ‚úÖ Fix ES Module Issues in Testing Scripts (2025-05-27)
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Description:** Fixed CommonJS `require()` syntax in testing scripts to use ES module `import` syntax, resolving the "require is not defined in ES module scope" error.

**Files Modified:**
- `run_all_comprehensive_tests.js` - Converted to ES modules
- `bug_analysis_and_tests.js` - Converted to ES modules  
- `tui_interactive_tests.js` - Converted to ES modules

**Changes Made:**
1. Replaced `const { spawn } = require('child_process')` with `import { spawn } from 'child_process'`
2. Replaced `const fs = require('fs')` with `import fs from 'fs'`
3. Replaced `const path = require('path')` with `import path from 'path'`
4. Added `import { fileURLToPath, pathToFileURL } from 'url'` for proper file path handling
5. Updated `if (require.main === module)` to use `if (import.meta.url === pathToFileURL(process.argv[1]).href)` for cross-platform compatibility
6. Replaced `module.exports =` with `export default`

**Testing Results:**
- Comprehensive testing suite now runs successfully
- Identified 7 critical bugs still present in the DataPilot application
- Found 1 bug that appears to be fixed (BUG_002: "[object Object]" in INT analysis)
- Generated detailed test reports for further development prioritisation

**Next Steps:**
- Address the remaining high-priority bugs identified by the test suite
- Focus on undefined property errors and context relevance issues
- Improve error handling and performance optimisation

## Discovered During Work

### üîç Critical Bugs Identified During Testing
- **BUG_001:** "undefined" appearing in analysis results (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **BUG_003:** Inappropriate context suggestions for medical data (MEDIUM PRIORITY)  
- **BUG_004:** Hardcoded "sales performance" questions for medical data (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **BUG_005:** Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length') (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **BUG_006:** Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'slice') (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **BUG_008:** Copy functionality undefined/broken (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

### üìä Testing Infrastructure Improvements Needed
- Manual TUI testing protocols for copy functionality
- Automated performance benchmarking for large files
