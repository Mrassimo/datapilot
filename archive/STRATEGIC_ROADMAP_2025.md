## üö® Critical Architectural Risks (Address Immediately)

### 1. **YAML Knowledge Base Scalability Crisis**
**Problem**: The Data Engineering Archaeology system relies on a single YAML file that could become a bottleneck.

**Risks Identified**:
- **Concurrency**: Multiple instances could corrupt data
- **Scalability**: YAML parsing becomes slow with large knowledge bases  
- **Recovery**: Single point of failure for `eng` command
- **Schema Evolution**: Backward compatibility challenges

**Strategic Solution - Phase 1 (Week 1-2)**:
```javascript
// Create distributed knowledge base architecture
class DistributedKnowledgeBase {
  constructor() {
    this.storage = new Map(); // In-memory cache
    this.persistenceLayer = new KnowledgePersistence();
    this.lockManager = new FileLockManager();
  }
  
  async writeKnowledge(key, data) {
    await this.lockManager.acquireLock();
    try {
      // Write with versioning and backup
      await this.persistenceLayer.writeWithBackup(key, data);
    } finally {
      this.lockManager.releaseLock();
    }
  }
}
```

**Strategic Solution - Phase 2 (Month 2-3)**:
- Migrate to SQLite for better concurrency
- Implement schema versioning system
- Add automatic backup/recovery mechanisms
- Create knowledge base migration tools

### 2. **Custom Test Framework Technical Debt**
**Problem**: Maintenance burden and contributor onboarding friction.

**Strategic Solution**:
- **Immediate**: Create Jest migration plan
- **Phase 1**: Hybrid approach - new tests in Jest, existing in custom framework
- **Phase 2**: Full migration with automated conversion scripts
- **Benefit**: Access to ecosystem tools, easier contributor onboarding

### 3. **Component Coupling Crisis**
**Problem**: Changes in core utilities cascade across all commands.

**Strategic Solution**:
```javascript
// Implement dependency injection and interfaces
class CommandExecutor {
  constructor(dependencies) {
    this.parser = dependencies.parser;
    this.formatter = dependencies.formatter;
    this.knowledgeBase = dependencies.knowledgeBase;
  }
}

// This allows easier testing and reduces coupling
```

## üìä Strategic Blind Spots Analysis

### 1. **TUI Testing Complexity**
**Current Status**: Automated TUI testing is notoriously difficult  
**Review Quote**: *"ensuring coverage of all UI states, interactions, and visual regressions across different terminal emulators and OSes can be a continuous challenge"*

**Strategic Response**:
- **Phase 1**: Implement headless TUI testing framework
- **Phase 2**: Create visual regression testing for terminal output
- **Phase 3**: Multi-terminal compatibility matrix

### 2. **Australian Data Awareness Paradox**
**Strength**: Unique AU-specific features (postcodes, ABNs, phone numbers)  
**Blind Spot**: May limit international adoption

**Strategic Solution**:
- **Keep AU features** as a competitive advantage
- **Add plugin architecture** for other regions
- **Create "Regional Data Packs"** - start with US, UK, Canada
- **Market positioning**: "The only CSV tool that understands your local data formats"

### 3. **Smart Sampling Reliability Gap**
**Risk**: Sampling might miss crucial information for some analyses

**Strategic Solution**:
```javascript
class SmartSampler {
  constructor() {
    this.strategies = {
      outlierDetection: new StratifiedSampler(),
      duplicateDetection: new FullScanRequiredAnalyzer(),
      basicStats: new RandomSampler()
    };
  }
  
  async sample(data, analysisType) {
    const strategy = this.strategies[analysisType];
    return await strategy.process(data);
  }
}
```

### 4. **LLM Output Quality Consistency**
**Risk**: Variable quality of generated insights across different datasets

**Strategic Solution**:
- Implement LLM output validation pipeline
- Create quality scoring system for generated insights
- Add user feedback loop for continuous improvement
- Develop dataset-specific prompt optimization
