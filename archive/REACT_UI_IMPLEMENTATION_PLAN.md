Okay, here's a comprehensive plan to transition DataPilot to a React-based UI with a "single button" (single command) launch experience, leveraging modern tools like Vite and ShadCN/UI for a "really pretty" and efficient interface.

This plan assumes your core DataPilot analysis logic in `/src/commands/` and `/src/utils/` is already modular and can be called programmatically, which is ideal for creating an API backend.

**Transition Plan: DataPilot to Single-Button React UI**

**Phase 1: Frontend Foundation & Initial Setup**

* **Step 1: Create React Frontend Project**
    * **Action:** Inside your DataPilot repository, create a new directory (e.g., `frontend/` or `webui/`).
    * **Action:** Initialize a new React project within this directory using Vite for a fast development environment:
        ```bash
        cd frontend
        npm create vite@latest . -- --template react # Or react-ts for TypeScript
        npm install
        ```
* **Step 2: Integrate UI Styling (Tailwind CSS & ShadCN/UI)**
    * **Action:** Follow the official Vite guide to install and configure Tailwind CSS in your new React project.
    * **Action:** Initialize ShadCN/UI within the `frontend/` project. This typically involves running a ShadCN/UI init command that sets up necessary configurations and allows you to add components.
        ```bash
        # Inside frontend/ directory
        npx shadcn-ui@latest init
        ```
    * **Action:** Add a few basic ShadCN/UI components (e.g., `Button`, `Card`, `Input`) to test the setup:
        ```bash
        npx shadcn-ui@latest add button card input
        ```
* **Step 3: Design Basic UI Shell and Navigation**
    * **Action:** Create a main layout component in React (e.g., `App.jsx` or a dedicated `Layout.jsx`). This could include a sidebar for navigation (listing analysis types like EDA, INT, VIS) and a main content area.
    * **Action:** Implement basic client-side routing (e.g., using `react-router-dom`) if you plan to have distinct "pages" for different functions or analyses.
    * **Action:** Create placeholder components for the main views/pages.

**Phase 2: Backend API Development (Node.js & Express.js)**

* **Step 4: Setup Local Web Server**
    * **Action:** In your main DataPilot project root, install Express.js: `npm install express`.
    * **Action:** Create a new script (e.g., `webServer.js` in the root or `src/` directory) or plan to integrate server logic into `bin/datapilot.js` for the new web UI command. This script will initialize an Express server.
* **Step 5: Create API Endpoints for DataPilot Commands**
    * **Action:** In your Express server setup, define API endpoints for each core DataPilot analysis function (EDA, INT, VIS, ENG, LLM). Examples:
        * `POST /api/analyze/eda`
        * `POST /api/analyze/int`
        * ...and so on.
    * **Action:** These endpoint handlers should:
        * Accept input (e.g., CSV file path, analysis options, or potentially uploaded file data) via request body (JSON).
        * Call the corresponding asynchronous functions from your existing `/src/commands/` modules.
        * Handle responses from these functions and send results (or error messages) back as JSON.
        * Consider data streaming for large outputs if applicable, though JSON responses are simpler to start.
* **Step 6: Serve React Frontend Static Assets**
    * **Action:** Configure your Express server to serve the static files (HTML, CSS, JS) that will be generated when you build your React frontend. These are typically in a `dist` folder inside your `frontend/` directory.
        ```javascript
        // Example in your Express server setup
        const path = require('path');
        app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '..', 'frontend', 'dist'))); // Adjust path as needed

        app.get('*', (req, res) => {
          res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '..', 'frontend', 'dist', 'index.html')); // For SPA routing
        });
        ```

**Phase 3: Frontend-Backend Integration & UI Feature Implementation**

* **Step 7: Implement File Input/Selection in UI**
    * **Action:** In your React app, create components using ShadCN/UI elements for users to select local CSV files (e.g., using an `<input type="file">`).
    * **Action:** Determine how to handle the file:
        * Option A: Send the file path to the backend, and the Node.js server reads it.
        * Option B (More web-idiomatic): Read the file content in the browser using JavaScript (FileReader API), then send the content (e.g., as a string or a FormData object) to the backend. This avoids needing direct file system access from the server based on arbitrary client paths.
* **Step 8: Trigger Analyses and Fetch Results from UI**
    * **Action:** Create UI elements (e.g., forms with ShadCN/UI inputs and buttons) for users to select analysis types and specify options.
    * **Action:** When a user triggers an analysis:
        * Use the `fetch` API or a library like `axios` in React to make asynchronous POST requests to your backend API endpoints.
        * Include the file data/reference and any analysis options in the request body.
* **Step 9: Display Analysis Results Dynamically**
    * **Action:** Develop React components to receive and render the JSON analysis results from the backend.
    * **Action:** Use ShadCN/UI components (Tables, Cards, formatted text blocks, etc.) to display the insights in a structured, "pretty," and user-friendly manner. Your LLM-optimized text output should format well.
    * **Action:** Ensure easy text selection and copying by using standard HTML elements for text display.
* **Step 10: Implement UI Feedback (Loading States & Error Handling)**
    * **Action:** Provide visual feedback in the UI during API calls (e.g., loading spinners or messages).
    * **Action:** Gracefully display any error messages returned from the backend if an analysis fails or input is invalid.

**Phase 4: "Single Button" Launch & Build Integration**

* **Step 11: Create CLI Command for Web UI Launch**
    * **Action:** In `bin/datapilot.js`, using `commander`, add a new command (e.g., `webui`) or modify the existing `ui` command.
    * **Action:** The handler for this command should:
        1.  Start your Express.js web server (from Step 4).
        2.  After the server successfully starts and is listening on a port (e.g., 3000 or a dynamically chosen one), use the `open` npm package (`npm install open`) to automatically launch the user's default web browser to the server's address (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
        ```javascript
        // Example snippet for the commander action
        const { exec } = require('child_process');
        const open = require('open');
        // ... server starting logic ...
        const port = 3000; // Or your chosen port
        server.listen(port, async () => {
          console.log(`DataPilot web UI is running at http://localhost:${port}`);
          await open(`http://localhost:${port}`);
        });
        ```
* **Step 12: Integrate Build Process**
    * **Action:** Add/update npm scripts in your root `package.json`:
        * `"build:frontend": "cd frontend && npm run build"`
        * `"start:webui": "node path/to/your/webServer.js"` (or directly `node bin/datapilot.js webui`)
        * A script that first builds the frontend, then allows running the web UI.
    * **Action:** Ensure that when DataPilot is packaged for global installation (e.g., via `npm install -g datapilot`), the `frontend/dist` directory is included in the published package, and the server knows how to locate these static assets. Your `rollup.config.js` might need adjustments if it's involved in the overall packaging, or you might rely on npm's `files` property in `package.json`.

**Phase 5: Testing & Refinement**

* **Step 13: Comprehensive Testing**
    * **Action:** Test all UI interactions, file handling, API communications, and display of results for each analysis type.
    * **Action:** Test the `webui` launch command on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) to ensure the browser opens correctly.
    * **Action:** Perform basic cross-browser compatibility checks (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
* **Step 14: Iterate and Refine UX**
    * **Action:** Gather feedback on the user experience.
    * **Action:** Refine the UI design, workflow, and performance based on testing and feedback.
