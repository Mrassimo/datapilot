================================================================================


==============================
=== VISUALISATION ANALYSIS ===
==============================
Dataset: california_housing.csv
Generated: 2025-05-25 10:08:09

RECOMMENDED VISUALISATIONS:


[1] Customer Segment Bar Chart
- XAxis: ocean_proximity
- YAxis: average median_house_value
- Purpose: Compare median_house_value across ocean_proximity categories
- KeyInsight: ISLAND median_house_value is 3.0x higher than INLAND
- Enhancement: Add error bars showing standard deviation

[2] Scatter Plot with Regression
- XAxis: total_bedrooms
- YAxis: households
- Color: ocean_proximity
- Size: number_of_records
- Purpose: Explore relationship between total_bedrooms and households
- KeyInsight: Strong correlation (r=0.98) positive relationship

[3] Distribution Histogram
- Variable: median_house_value
- Bins: 50
- YAxis: Frequency
- Purpose: Understand median_house_value distribution
- KeyInsight: approximately normal distribution with median $179,700.00, mean $206,855.82

[4] Donut Chart: Category Distribution
- Category: ocean_proximity
- Values: Count or sum of values
- Purpose: Show proportion of ocean_proximity
- KeyInsight: <1H OCEAN accounts for 44.3% of total

DASHBOARD LAYOUT SUGGESTION:
Top row: Time series showing overall trend
Middle row: Customer segment comparison | Geographic heat map
Bottom row: Transaction distribution | Correlation matrix

INTERACTIVE FEATURES TO INCLUDE:
1. Date range selector for time series
2. Drill-down capability on customer segments
3. Hover tooltips showing exact values
4. Export functionality for each chart
5. Filter controls for categorical variables
6. Zoom and pan for scatter plots
7. Click-to-filter across all charts

COLOR PALETTE RECOMMENDATION:
- Primary: #2E86AB (blue) for main metrics
- Secondary: #F24236 (red) for negative/warning values
- Accent: #F6AE2D (yellow) for highlights
- Neutral: #2F3E46 (dark gray) for text and axes
- Background: #FFFFFF (white) or #F8F9FA (light gray)
- Ensure colorblind-friendly options
- Use consistent colors across all visualizations

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Dataset size: 20640 rows - consider sampling or aggregation for performance
- Recommended libraries: D3.js for custom visualizations, Chart.js for simple charts, Plotly for interactive dashboards
- Consider dimensionality reduction (PCA) for correlation matrix
- Add loading states for data processing
- Implement responsive design for mobile viewing
