## Test Data and Scenarios

### Test Data Created
- **Standard Employee Data**: 5 rows, 7 columns with realistic data types
- **Department Data**: Related data for join analysis testing
- **Large Dataset**: 10,000 rows for performance testing
- **Complex CSV**: Edge cases with quotes, commas, newlines, emoji
- **Problematic Data**: Missing values, invalid formats for quality testing

### Edge Cases Tested
- CSV files with special characters and formatting
- Binary files and unknown formats
- Missing files and invalid paths
- Memory constraints and large file handling
- Concurrent operations and resource cleanup

## Integration Test Results Expected

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Overview Analysis**: < 10 seconds for standard files

- **Cache Operations**: Sub-second for repeated analyses

### Functionality Validation
- **All Commands**: Execute successfully with valid inputs
- **Error Handling**: Provide helpful messages and suggestions
- **Output Generation**: Create correctly formatted files
- **Multi-File Analysis**: Detect relationships and provide recommendations

### Quality Assurance
- **Australian English**: No American spellings in outputs
- **Memory Management**: No memory leaks or excessive usage
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of failures
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Existing workflows unchanged

## Running the Tests

### Individual Test Suites
```bash
# Run specific integration test
npx jest tests/integration/current-functionality-integration.test.ts

# Run all integration tests
npm run test tests/integration

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage tests/integration
```

### Comprehensive Test Runner
```bash
# Run complete integration validation
node test-comprehensive-integration.js

# Make executable and run
chmod +x test-comprehensive-integration.js
./test-comprehensive-integration.js
```

### Performance Testing
```bash
# Run streaming performance tests

3. Add command definitions to argument parser
4. Update CLI to handle new command types

### 2. Implementation Priority
1. **High**: Dry-run functionality for analysis estimation
2. **High**: Enhanced multi-file relationship analysis
3. **Medium**: Performance dashboard and cache management
4. **Medium**: Validation and file info commands

### 3. Quality Assurance
1. Ensure all outputs use Australian English spellings
2. Validate memory management in streaming scenarios
3. Test error handling with comprehensive scenarios
4. Verify performance doesn't degrade with changes

## Future Enhancements
