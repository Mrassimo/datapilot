### Section 1: Comprehensive Dataset & Analysis Overview
This section provides a detailed snapshot of the dataset properties, how it was processed, and the context of this analysis run.

**1.1. Input Data File Details:**
    * Original Filename: `your-data.csv`
    * Full Resolved Path: `/path/to/your-data.csv` (Displayed if available & privacy settings allow)
    * File Size (on disk): XX.XX MB (or KB, e.g., 0.05MB)
    * MIME Type (detected/inferred): `text/csv`
    * File Last Modified (OS Timestamp): YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS (UTC)
    * File Hash (e.g., SHA256): `[hash_string]` (For data integrity verification)

**1.2. Data Ingestion & Parsing Parameters:**
    * Data Source Type: Local File System
    * Parsing Engine Utilized: (e.g., "DataPilot Advanced CSV Parser vA.B.C")
    * Time Taken for Parsing & Initial Load: X.XXX seconds
    * Detected Character Encoding: `utf8`
        * Encoding Detection Method: (e.g., Heuristic analysis, Byte pattern matching)
        * Encoding Confidence: High (98%)
    * Detected Delimiter Character: `,` (Comma)
        * Delimiter Detection Method: (e.g., Character frequency analysis within sample lines)
        * Delimiter Confidence: High (95%)
    * Detected Line Ending Format: `LF` (Unix-style) (or `CRLF` for Windows-style)
    * Detected Quoting Character: `"` (Double Quote) (or e.g., "None Detected", "'")
        * Empty Lines Encountered: N (e.g., 0, or "2 empty lines ignored at file end")
    * Header Row Processing:
        * Header Presence: Detected
        * Header Row Number(s): 1
        * Column Names Derived From: Header Row
    * Byte Order Mark (BOM): Not Detected (or "UTF-8 BOM Detected and Handled")
    * Initial Row/Line Scan Limit for Detection: (e.g., First 1000 lines or 1MB of data)

**1.3. Dataset Structural Dimensions & Initial Profile:**
    * Total Rows Read (including header, if any): NNN,NNN + H
    * Total Rows of Data (excluding header): NNN,NNN (e.g., 1,338, 150)
    * Total Columns Detected: MM (e.g., 7, 5)
    * Total Data Cells (Data Rows * Columns): TTT,TTT
    * List of Column Names (M) and Original Index:
        1.  (Index 0) `column_name_1`
        2.  (Index 1) `column_name_2`
        ...
        M.  (Index M-1) `column_name_M`
    * Estimated In-Memory Size (Post-Parsing & Initial Type Guessing): YY.YY MB
    * Average Row Length (bytes, approximate): ZZZ bytes
    * Dataset Sparsity (Initial Estimate): (e.g., "Primarily dense" or "X% sparse cells based on initial scan for empty strings/nulls")

**1.4. Analysis Configuration & Execution Context:**
    * Full Command Executed: `datapilot all your-data.csv --optionX valueY --verbose`
    * Analysis Mode Invoked: Comprehensive Deep Scan
    * Timestamp of Analysis Start: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS (UTC)
    * Global Dataset Sampling Strategy: Full dataset analysis (No record sampling applied for initial overview and EDA)
    * DataPilot Modules Activated for this Run: (e.g., File I/O, Parser, QualityAssessor, EDAEngine, VisEngine, ReportGenerator)
    * Processing Time for Section 1 Generation: Z.ZZZ seconds
    * (Optional, if enabled by user) Host Environment Details:
        * Operating System: e.g., macOS Sonoma 14.5
        * System Architecture: e.g., arm64 / x86_64
        * Execution Runtime: e.g., Node.js v20.11.0 (running transpiled TypeScript)
        * Available CPU Cores / Memory (at start of analysis): X cores / Y GB

**Key expansions in this version of Section 1 include:**

* **1.1. Input Data File Details:** Added MIME type and an optional file hash for integrity checks.
* **1.2. Data Ingestion & Parsing Parameters:** More detail on detection methods and confidence for encoding/delimiter, specifics about line endings, quoting, empty lines, BOM, and the scope of initial scanning for these detections.
* **1.3. Dataset Structural Dimensions & Initial Profile:** Differentiates total lines read vs. data rows, lists column names with their original index, adds average row length, and an initial estimate of dataset sparsity.
* **1.4. Analysis Configuration & Execution Context:** Specifies the full command, modules activated, and more detailed (optional) host environment information.

This more granular information in Section 1 should provide a very robust and transparent starting point for any analysis that follows, catering to the need for an in-depth overview.

How does this expanded Section 1 look to you? We can refine it further or, when you're ready, move on to thinking about how the other sections will build upon this foundation, keeping your key analytical categories in mind.
