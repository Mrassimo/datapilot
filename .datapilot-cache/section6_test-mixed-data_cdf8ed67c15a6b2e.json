(Classification and Regression Trees) methodology for regression:\n\n**Core Algorithm:**\n1. **Recursive Binary Partitioning:** The algorithm recursively splits the dataset into two subsets based on feature values that optimize the splitting criterion.\n\n2. **Splitting Criterion:** Uses variance reduction to evaluate potential splits. For each possible split on each feature, the algorithm calculates the improvement in the criterion and selects the best split.\n\n3. **Greedy Approach:** At each node, CART makes the locally optimal choice without considering future splits, which makes it computationally efficient but potentially suboptimal globally.\n\n4. **Binary Splits Only:** Unlike other decision tree algorithms, CART produces only binary splits, which simplifies the tree structure and interpretation.\n\n**Mathematical Foundation:**\nFor regression trees, the splitting criterion is variance reduction:\n\n**Variance Reduction = Variance(parent) - [weighted_avg(Variance(left_child), Variance(right_child))]**\n\nWhere:\n- Variance(S) = Σ(yi - ȳ)² / |S|\n- ȳ is the mean target value in set S\n- Weights are proportional to the number of samples in each child\n\n**Prediction:** For a leaf node, prediction = mean of target values in that leaf\n\n**Key Advantages:**\n- Non-parametric: No assumptions about data distribution\n- Handles mixed data types naturally (numerical and categorical)\n- Automatic feature selection through recursive splitting\n- Robust to outliers (splits based on order, not exact values)\n- Highly interpretable through visual tree structure\n- Can capture non-linear relationships and feature interactions\n\n**Limitations to Consider:**\n- High variance: Small changes in data can lead to very different trees\n- Bias toward features with many possible splits\n- Can easily overfit without proper pruning\n- Instability: Sensitive to data perturbations","splittingCriterion":"variance_reduction","stoppingCriteria":[{"criterion":"max_depth","recommendedValue":7,"reasoning":"Limits tree complexity to prevent overfitting.
