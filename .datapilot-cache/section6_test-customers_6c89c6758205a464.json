Regression Trees) methodology for classification:\n\n**Core Algorithm:**\n1. **Recursive Binary Partitioning:** The algorithm recursively splits the dataset into two subsets based on feature values that optimize the splitting criterion.\n\n2. **Splitting Criterion:** Uses Gini impurity or information gain to evaluate potential splits. For each possible split on each feature, the algorithm calculates the improvement in the criterion and selects the best split.\n\n3. **Greedy Approach:** At each node, CART makes the locally optimal choice without considering future splits, which makes it computationally efficient but potentially suboptimal globally.\n\n4. **Binary Splits Only:** Unlike other decision tree algorithms, CART produces only binary splits, which simplifies the tree structure and interpretation.\n\n**Mathematical Foundation:**\nFor classification trees, common splitting criteria include:\n\n**Gini Impurity:** Gini(S) = 1 - Σ(pi)²\nwhere pi is the proportion of samples belonging to class i\n\n**Information Gain (Entropy):** \n- Entropy(S) = -Σ(pi * log2(pi))\n- Information Gain = Entropy(parent) - weighted_avg(Entropy(children))\n\n**Prediction:** For a leaf node, prediction = majority class in that leaf\n**Probability Estimation:** P(class i) = proportion of class i samples in leaf\n\n**Key Advantages:**\n- Non-parametric: No assumptions about data distribution\n- Handles mixed data types naturally (numerical and categorical)\n- Automatic feature selection through recursive splitting\n- Robust to outliers (splits based on order, not exact values)\n- Highly interpretable through visual tree structure\n- Can capture non-linear relationships and feature interactions\n\n**Limitations to Consider:**\n- High variance: Small changes in data can lead to very different trees\n- Bias toward features with many possible splits\n- Can easily overfit without proper pruning\n- Instability: Sensitive to data perturbations","splittingCriterion":"gini","stoppingCriteria":[{"criterion":"max_depth","recommendedValue":7,"reasoning":"Limits tree complexity to prevent overfitting.
